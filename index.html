          MENTORSHIP PROGRAM IN MEMORY OF JIM WALROD
        </h1>
        <p>
          8-Ball Community has created the Jim’s Web mentorship program to keep
          this spirit alive. The program will connect established arts
          professionals with emerging creatives to help them realize creative
          projects around a theme, in fields including fashion design, fine art,
          architecture/interiors, product design, publishing, and photography.
          The inaugural theme for Jim’s Web is “community,” in honor of Jim’s
          ability to bring people together. Six mentorships -one in each
          discipline- will be awarded annually. Awardees will receive a grant of
          $3,000 and access to their mentor’s studio or office space to realize
          their project over a six month period. The projects will be showcased
          in a group exhibition at the end of the program.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are currently seeking mentors to contribute their expertise to one

          six month mentorship period (between February and August 2019) and
